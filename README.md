# Properties

This very lightweight API was designed to allow programmatic access to properties and their descriptions.
The types api uses properties a lot to dynamically define for example XSD Schema validation rules.

The programmatic access is used mostly to generate a GUI interface that allows you to know which properties can be filled in and how.
